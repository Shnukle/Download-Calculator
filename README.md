# Download-Calculator
This python program will calculate how long it will take for a file to download taking download speed and file size into account

To use this program simply enter your download speed (can be mixed numbers), enter what size measurement you want to use(megabytes or gigabytes) and the size of the file. I have left documentation in the script to show which sections do what.
